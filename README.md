Description
-----------

The Simple REST API with CRUD Operations allows users to perform basic CRUD operations on a specified data collection. It provides endpoints for creating new data entries, retrieving existing data entries, updating data entries, and deleting data entries. The API uses a MongoDB database to store and retrieve the data, and it communicates with clients using JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format.

Features
--------

The Simple REST API with CRUD Operations offers the following features:

-   **Create Operation**: Users can create new data entries by sending a POST request to the appropriate endpoint.
-   **Read Operation**: Users can retrieve existing data entries by sending a GET request to the appropriate endpoint.
-   **Update Operation**: Users can update existing data entries by sending a PUT request to the appropriate endpoint.
-   **Delete Operation**: Users can delete existing data entries by sending a DELETE request to the appropriate endpoint.
-   **Validation**: The API validates incoming requests to ensure data integrity and consistency.
-   **Error Handling**: The API handles errors gracefully and provides appropriate error messages and status codes.
-   **Database Integration**: The API utilizes a MongoDB database to store and retrieve data.

Installation
------------

To run the Simple REST API with CRUD Operations locally, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository:

-   `git clone https://github.com/DimitarMitev92/simple-rest-api-with-crud.git`

    -   Navigate to the project directory:

    -   `cd simple-rest-api-with-crud`

    -   Install the required dependencies:

    -   `npm install`

    -   Start the server:

1.  `npm start`

That's it! The API should now be running on your local machine.

Usage
-----

Once the API is running, you can interact with it by sending HTTP requests to the appropriate endpoints. Use a tool like Postman or cURL to send requests and test the API's functionality. Here are the basic endpoints you can use:

-   `POST /api/data`: Create a new data entry by sending a POST request with the required data.
-   `GET /api/data`: Retrieve all existing data entries by sending a GET request.
-   `GET /api/data/:id`: Retrieve a specific data entry by sending a GET request with the corresponding ID.
-   `PUT /api/data/:id`: Update a specific data entry by sending a PUT request with the corresponding ID and updated data.
-   `DELETE /api/data/:id`: Delete a specific data entry by sending a DELETE request with the corresponding ID.

Make sure to replace `:id` with the actual ID of the data entry you want to retrieve, update, or delete.

Feel free to customize the API or add additional features to suit your needs.
